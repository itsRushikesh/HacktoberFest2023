Two-wheelers are in high demand in India due to their ease of maneuveringÂ around congested roads, reduced carbon emissions, higher fuel efficiency, and ability to provide a cost-effective means of transportation as compared to three or four-wheeled vehicles. In addition, rising urbanization, improved road infrastructure, and an increase in the number of female consumers are boosting two-wheeler demand in India."</p>', unsafe_allow_html=True)
